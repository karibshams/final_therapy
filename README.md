## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/final_therapy.git
cd final_therapy
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create `.env` File

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-key
PDF_FOLDER_PATH=./pdf/
VECTOR_STORE_PATH=./vector_store/
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM
```

### 5. Add Therapy PDFs

Place your PDF therapy documents in the `./pdf/` folder. These will be embedded into the vector database.

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. Run the AI Backend (for API or CLI)

```bash
python main.py
```

### 2. Run the Streamlit Dashboard (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run test_dashboard.py
```

This will launch an interactive web interface for:

* Chatting with the AI
* Recording voice and receiving audio replies
* Running automated therapy tests
* Viewing session analytics and vector stats

## 🧠 Therapy Types Supported

```python
from prompt import TherapyType

TherapyType.ANXIETY
TherapyType.DEPRESSION
